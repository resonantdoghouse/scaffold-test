# Scaffold Test

NPM package testing. Creates folders and files when running the command

To use the tool, to scaffold a new app you can run:

`npx @onomicon/scaffold-test project-name`

For local development you can install globally from the projects `package.json` by running `npm i -g`. Then you can run `npx @onomicon/scaffold-test project-name` which should use the updated code.
